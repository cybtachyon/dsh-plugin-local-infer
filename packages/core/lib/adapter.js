/**
 * EngineAdapter is the abstract base one subclass implements per engine. It
 * owns the engine's parameter surface and turns a config into a launch plan,
 * deploys it, health-checks it, and stops it. NInfer is the canonical adapter
 * that supports both docker and local; the others follow the same shape.
 * `deploy` takes the platform config so it clones the fork into the engine
 * directory; `healthCheck` takes poll options so the service prices the poll
 * from the config.
